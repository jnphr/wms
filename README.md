# Warehouse Management System
This program forms part of a warehouse management system for a fashion and lifestyle brand.\
Focusing on footwear, the program supports store managers based internationally who would
like to be able to:
* search for products by code,
* determine which products have the highest and lowest quantities,
* calculate the total value of each stock item.


## Installation

You can set the directory path and run the python file as usual.

```bash
python wms.py
```


## Functionality

The program assumes an equal quantity for every size per stock-keeping unit; this database feature can be developed further.

## Development

Do not hesitate to send a [message](https://github.blog/2011-03-23-mention-somebody-they-re-notified/) if you would like to contribute.
